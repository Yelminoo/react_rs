# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:


## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# React Vite Project

This project was bootstrapped with Vite and the React template.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
	```powershell
	npm install
	```
2. Start the development server:
	```powershell
	npm run dev
	```

## Notes
- Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+ is recommended for Vite 7.x. You are currently using Node.js 20.16.0. Please upgrade Node.js for best compatibility.
- The default app runs at http://localhost:5173/

## Project Structure
- `src/` contains your React components and main app logic.
- `index.html` is the entry HTML file.
- `vite.config.js` is the Vite configuration file.
